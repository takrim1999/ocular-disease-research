# Comparative Analysis of ResNet50 vs VGG19 for Diffusion-based Data Augmentation in Ocular Disease Diagnosis

## Abstract

Deep learning models have revolutionized medical image analysis, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieving remarkable success in ocular disease diagnosis. While the original research demonstrated the effectiveness of VGG19 architecture combined with diffusion-based data augmentation, this study investigates whether modern CNN architectures like ResNet50 can provide superior performance. We present a comprehensive comparison between VGG19 and ResNet50 architectures applied to the same ocular disease classification task using the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50 achieves significant improvements over VGG19 across multiple performance metrics, with enhanced training stability and better generalization capabilities when combined with synthetic data augmentation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The field of medical image analysis has witnessed unprecedented advances with the advent of deep learning technologies. In ocular disease diagnosis, convolutional neural networks have shown exceptional promise in automating the detection and classification of various retinal conditions. The original research by Aktas et al. (2024) demonstrated the effectiveness of combining VGG19 architecture with diffusion-based synthetic data generation for improving classification performance on imbalanced medical datasets.

### 1.2 Motivation

While VGG19 provided a solid foundation for the original research, modern CNN architectures have evolved significantly. ResNet50, introduced by He et al. (2016), addresses several limitations of earlier architectures through residual learning, enabling the training of much deeper networks without the vanishing gradient problem. This study aims to investigate whether these architectural improvements translate to better performance in medical image classification tasks.

### 1.3 Research Questions

1. Does ResNet50 outperform VGG19 in ocular disease classification accuracy?
2. How do the architectures compare in terms of training stability and convergence?
3. Which architecture better leverages synthetic data augmentation?
4. What are the computational trade-offs between the two approaches?

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 CNN Architectures in Medical Imaging

The evolution of CNN architectures has been driven by the need for better feature representation and training efficiency. VGG19, with its simple yet effective design, has been widely adopted in medical imaging tasks. However, the introduction of residual networks (ResNet) marked a significant advancement in deep learning architectures.

### 2.2 Data Augmentation in Medical AI

Traditional data augmentation techniques, while effective, have limitations in medical imaging due to the need to preserve diagnostic features. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly diffusion models, have opened new possibilities for creating realistic synthetic medical images that maintain clinical relevance.

### 2.3 Ocular Disease Classification

The ODIR dataset has become a benchmark for ocular disease classification, containing five major categories: Glaucoma, Cataract, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Hypertension, and Myopia. The class imbalance in this dataset makes it an ideal testbed for data augmentation techniques.
